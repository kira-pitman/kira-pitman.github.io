    <h2 class="blog-post-heading">Explain a time you were blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p class="blog-post">
          A recent simply problem I was blocked on was a question in the manipulating the dom challenge in the javascript kata section. I was struggling with figuring out how to tell part of my code what it's value should be by assigning it a value previously defined in my code. I felt quite frustrated at the time as my pseudocode and logic was sound, but I couldn't figure out the right word to use to communicate to my computer what I wanted it to do. 

          </br></br> I tried doublechecking my pseudocode, googling potential approaches and solutions to my problem, tried a variety of different solutions and was still stuck. Given that none of these worked, I then ended up asking someone from my cohort for help. This solved the problem for me, as they have a bit more experience working within javascript and pointed me in the right direction.

          </br></br> This block and its resolution really reinforced that I do actually know my limitations and when I need to ask for help, and that doing so is a much more productive use of my time than struggling through a bit of syntax that I don't understand! If I get to the point where I'm not actively trying different things for a reason, and just frustratingly trying the same solution and looking for different results, taking a step back or asking for another perspective is worthwhile - especially when I am not yet familiar enough with javascript to be able to easily spot my syntax based mistakes!

    <h2 class="blog-post-heading">Explain a time you elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p class="blog-post">
        A time a elegantly solved a problem was during the super fizzbuzz challenge in javascript kata! Having to write a function in order to return specific words for specific numbers wasn't something I had done before so I was quite proud I managed to solve it in one go and feel comfortable and confident through my process of doing so. I started by checking all the code requirements stipulated by the tests, wrote my step by step pseudocode and tried writing something. While writing my pseudocode I was able to recall some similar code that I had written for a previous sprint challenge that I could build off to solve the problem. 

         </br></br> Throughout the problem solving process I felt very present in what I was doing - each line of code was thought through and intentional and I was able to justify everything I was writing. I think my pseudocode really helped with this as it was most similar to an ordered checklist rather than a general vibe of things to put into my solution (as can often be the case with unfamiliar problems until I can narrow down the direction I should take).

         </br></br> I think it also reinforced that having a base to build upon, rather than coming up with something completely new really helps my problem solving. In this case it was provided by previously written code, but in cases where that isn't applicable having a similar example or just trying to write something so I can get a measure for where I should be headed with my solution speeds up and increases my confidence in getting to a solution!
