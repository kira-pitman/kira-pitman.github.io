        What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        My long term goal from dev academy is to be able to transition my career
        into one that isn't just hardware focused and isn't constrained by only
        being able to work in R&D. Ideally I want to be software devloper
        adjacent where I can utilise my hardware skills and kinda have
        'practical' work to do with my hands, but still be able to do the
        software. However anything more software adjacent where I can have the
        flexibility to work remotely if required. I hope I can eventually work
        for a company/in a space that aligns with social progress I am
        passionate about e.g. being a software adjacent person for the burnett
        foundation Aotearoa.

      <h2 class="blog-post-question">
        My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      </h2>
      <!-- put this question in bullet points-->

      <h3 class="blog-post">Strengths</h3>

      <p class="blog-post">
        - I am used to being quite independent from my degree and research, so I
        am happy to organise and direct myself, and can also generally solve any
        issues I have - I am very intrinsically motivated and stubborn, so once
        I decide what work I want to do it is pretty easy for me to acheive that
        goal. - I have super good time management skills and am a good judge of
        how much time something will take me to get done - I know my pace for
        learning, and can listen to my own limitations e.g. when I get too tired
        I know to stop and have a break, know how long to focus for, know what
        kinda break I need, and I can structure my learning around other things
        in my life - I prefer to collaborate with others (even though I can work
        independently) and can generally find my place in whatever team I am
        placed in
      </p>

      <h3 class="blog-post">Limitations</h3>

      <p class="blog-post">
        - I can be pretty bad at asking for help for things that I either think
        are super easy and should know, or that everyone else finds really easy. </br>
        - I'm so used to being independent I'm more likely to struggle by myself
        than reach out for help, so I'll spend an hour on something that would
        be otherwise solved in 5 mins - I have a tendency to overwork myself and
        ignore my boundaries when I get super stressed about something or decide
        I need to do it (kinda the limiting side of my stubbornness and
        intrinsic motivation!) - I haven't really worked with people virtually
        before (at least not ones I haven't met in person) so am not super
        confident in how to approach those kinds of professional social
        interactions and how to work in those environments
      </p>

    <div class="blogpostcontentdiv">
      <h2 class="blog-post-question">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

      </h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        - How to navigate conflict resolution in professional spaces when I am the person who is being hurt 
        - It would be good to learn the social norms/expectations/cues in a specific work environment and be confident with how to exist/interact with people at work
        - I'd also like to get better at working virtually with people as I'm not confident in how to connecting and read how to interact with people if I haven't met them in person before
        - It would also be cool to develop more confidence in contributing to things in group situations, espeically virtually!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="blogpostcontentdiv">
      <h2 class="blog-post-question">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. <!--This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives-->

      </h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        - My time management skills will help a lot, and sticking to my daily study routine should assist with productivity e.g. continuing my morning and evening reflections, tracking my mood though the day to be able to identify stresses early, planning out my weekly schedule on Monday mornings.
- I will also aim to reach out to other learners or facilitators (as appropriate) with stresses impacting my learning before they make me shrivel into a husk 
- I'll aim to consistently communicate kindly and effectively with all other people, and always assume someone is trying their best!
- I will also aim to do my best in looking after myself! This includes sleeping and eating well, being kind to myself, and ensuring I am still maintaining my relationships and hobbies outside the course!
- Notice as soon as I can if I'm procrastinating and identify it's source and do my best to fix it before it ha a serious impact on my learning.

        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        -Reach out to my friends, my therapist have a chat about what is going on and get any emotional support I need.
        - Check that I have been eating regularly, sleeping enough, drinking water, and going outside regularly (and if not doing any of these things, set aside time to incorperate them in as needed)
        - Reach out to facilitators/appropriate DA staff to say I'm freaking out and get some help/support in making a plan to get me on track and relieve some pressure.

    <div class="blogpostcontentdiv">
      <h2 class="blog-post-question">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        
- Reach out on discord! This includes the main channels, as well as people in my own cohort and on our homegroup 8 channel
- I have a number of other friends who are developers who have offered to be on call as required for technical (for like outside hours stuff, and also sometimes I need someone in person to help read where I am at and what I need help with, so this is kinda an insulation for my bootcamp now being virtual)

    <div class="blogpostcontentdiv">
      <h2 class="blog-post-question">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        - Mostly that the facilitation team treats me with understanding and kindness, and always trust I am doing the best I can (even and espeically when it doesn't look like it). Also that y'all respond to things in a timely fashion during work hours, and that any stresses/external stuff impacting my learning is taken into account. Also it would be cool if y'all make an effort with my pronouns.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="blogpostcontentdiv">
      <h2 class="blog-post-question">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

      </h2>
