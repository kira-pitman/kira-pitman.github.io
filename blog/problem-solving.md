### Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

## were blocked on a simple problem: what was the problem? what problem-solving techniques did you use? how did you feel throughout the process? what did you learn? 

* problem was gradebook part of javascript kata.
* felt a bit frustrated
* pseudocode, googling, trying something, and asked Lari for help!
* learnt I need to sometimes step away and have a break and the solution will come to me! also that I need to make sure I am focused and present in my coding, and actively trying different things for a reason, not just randomly - I try to justify the reason I am making the change as I do it! also that I need to get over my pride and ask for help a lot sooner when I have exhausted my other problem solving techniques, as often with syntax problems it's an easy fix that I'm just not familiar with yet!

## elegantly solved a problem. what was the problem? what problem-solving
techniques did you use? how did you feel throughout the process? what did you
learn? 
 * javascript fizzbuzz
 * checked tests for code requirements, pseudocode, and tried something.
 * felt really confident and like I was properly present and thinking through each line of code that I was writing - not worn out and trying random stuff, but really thinking about what I was writing, and doublechecking with google and previous code samples if I was unsure.

## Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
techniques/processes: 
1. Pseudocode 
helllll yeeaahhh
2. Trying something 
hellll yeeaaahhh
3. Rubber ducky method 
I haven't really tried this one yet, but I feel confident about it, as I am very used to teaching others from tutoring for like a decade, and I know how helpful it can be! 
4. Reading error messages 
hell yeah - mostly alright, sometimes it can be a bit confusing, so I like to pair this with trying something so narrow down solution to errors
5. Console.logging 
helll yeeaahhh very helpful when looking at arrays and wanting to see what is in your object or whatever, as can clarify what you are actually doing!
6. Googling 
biggest yeaahhh boiii of them all - this is how I got my undergrad physics degree (as well as working with others) so I am very confident at this point!
7. Asking your peers for help 
hmm not super unconfident, but I do not love having to virtually ask for help,
8. Asking coaches for help 
hmmm not the most confident
9. Improving your process with reflection 
hell yeah! For the problems I get actively stuck on and struggle to solve, I note down afterwards what I learnt from solving that problem - both syntax and approaches I should make sure to reinclude, or ones to chuck out!

## Reflect on a time you
were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What
might you try differently next time?
* lmao on tuesday w Lari for gradebook issue! 
* reluctant as not super confident asking for help virtually! way more confident in person as I can see if someone is busy, read all their non verbal feedback on the situation and how they feel about helping me! I've also had some pretty bad experiences when having asked for help in the past so am v nervous about someone thinking I am an idiot for not knowing something that is simple, and is percieved as not needing to be explicitly explained.  also kinda humiliating (?) for me to have to ask in front of loads of people in channels w everyone from foundations, like prefer if just my cohort or a couple of people I've already talked to!
* set an actual timer for how long I have been struggling on that particular problem lmao and force myself to ask before then!
* also maybe just message someone individually instead of trying to hype myself up to message tech questions channel lmao
