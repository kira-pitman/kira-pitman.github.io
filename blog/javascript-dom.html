    <p class="blog-post">
      control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life
      e.g. cooking dinner, and having to chop different vegetables
      Control flow is the order in which a program executes statements. Programming languages can be distinguished by either not needing to describe it's control flow, declarative programming (HTML, CSS), or having control flow statements, imperative programming such as in Javascript. Control flow statements let the program choose which path to take when going through a statement. One example of this is using loops. Loops tell our program to do something starting from a certain initial state, until a certain final state, and what to do each time we have been through the loop before restarting it. This can kinda be thought of as though you are cooking dinner, and need to chop 3 onions. Your initial start state is 0 chopped onions, your final state is 3 chopped onions, and after each onion you chop you can add it to the pot of chopped onions, until there are three chopped onions in the pot. Once you have done this, the loop is completed and you can more onto the next part of your code (or cooking!)

  <h2 class="blog-post-heading">The DOM</h2>
  
  <p class="blog-post">
    DOM stands for document origin model! It is interacted with when using javascript through the console part of web pages. It's a data structure and programming interface with a hierarchical structure that your browser uses to make sense of everything going on. Everything that makes up your DOM is known as nodes - these are mostly just elements, but can be anything! The DOM isn't a programming language but without it javascript wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages etc..., but all of this can be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like javascript. The DOM is gateway to all the HTML elements that make up what you see on your website page and allows any change made in it using javascript to be reflected in what you see in your browser.

<p class="blog-post">One example of how you might interact with the DOM is if you want to interact with elements (the bits of information such as headings or paragraphs in your HTML code) in the HTML file. First search for the HTML element using document.querySelector(*id of thing you want to find*). This will find the first element in the HTML file with the specified id. To find all of the element in the HTML file, document.querySelctorAll(*id of thing you want to find*) can be used.

Examples
  document.querySelector('p') to find the first paragraph element in the HTML file. 
  
  document.querySeclectorAll('.dom') to find all elements in the dom class
