    <p class="blog-post">
      control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life
      e.g. cooking dinner, and having to chop different vegetables
      Control flow is the order in which a program executes statements. Programming languages can be distinguished by either not needing to describe it's control flow, declarative programming (HTML, CSS), or having control flow statements, imperative programming such as in Javascript. Control flow statements let the program choose which path to take when going through a statement. One example of this is using loops. Loops tell our program to do something starting from a certain initial state, until a certain final state, and what to do each time we have been through the loop before restarting it. This can kinda be thought of as though you are cooking dinner, and need to chop 3 onions. Your initial start state is 0 chopped onions, your final state is 3 chopped onions, and after each onion you chop you can add it to the pot of chopped onions, until there are three chopped onions in the pot. Once you have done this, the loop is completed and you can more onto the next part of your code (or cooking!)
