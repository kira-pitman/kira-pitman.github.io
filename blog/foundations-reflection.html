        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and

        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?

        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        I found that the most challenging aspect of the core learning was
        keeping to the timebox when writing my blog posts. I had already thought
        and put a lot of effort into all the core we have covered in
        foundations, so it was tempting to write everything I think and know
        about myself with regards to the blog post questions. Ensuring I am
        concisely answering the questions without feeling the need to explain
        every nuance in my perspective has been something I have had to focus
        on, and hopefully something I have improved on!
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-post">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p class="blog-post"></p>
      <h3 class="blog-post">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
