        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?

        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?

      <h3 class="blog-post">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        I found that the most challenging aspect of the core learning was
        keeping to the timebox when writing my blog posts. I had already thought
        and put a lot of effort into all the core we have covered in
        foundations, so it was tempting to write everything I think and know
        about myself with regards to the blog post questions. Ensuring I am
        concisely answering the questions without feeling the need to explain
        every nuance in my perspective has been something I have had to focus
        on, and hopefully something I have improved on!
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-post">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p class="blog-post">A large part of working as a developer is collaborating with other people. In order to be able to do this        
        effectively, it is really necessary to be aware of yourself, what you are thinking and feeling and why, and be
        able to communicate that to those around you. Not being able to do this
        makes it really difficult to collaborate with others, particularly in
        high stress environments, and especially when you are working from
        people different than you.
        </br>
        </br> While having the skills to be aware of
        yourself and communicate where you are at is important, having the
        awareness of where others are at allows you to meet them with kindness
        and have constructive and supportive conversations, rather than just
        seeing them at face value. All of this is crucial for creating
        supportive and effective working environments, both at an individual
        level, and for teams as a whole.
        </br>
        </br> As this emotional intelligence is key to being able to collaborate, and hence work, as a developer, it is a clear choice to spend some time nuturing and growing these skills. </p>
      <h3 class="blog-post">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        I don't think studying core learning has been a waste of time. All of the necessary self refleciton and emotional intelligence needed to succeed in collaborative environments is an ongoing process that takes consistent deliberate work. Although a lot of this can be extended on outside of the coursework, allocating time every week to reflect and consolidate within learning hours ensures that this internal work is continued, but also importantly that it is done within a development context.
        </br>
        </br>The interpersonal skills and self reflection to be done in a professional environemnt can differ from that in a personal one, and having the practice of navigating and exploring one's emotional intelligence and state in these spaces is crucial to ensuring that these skills are transferable to a working environment.
