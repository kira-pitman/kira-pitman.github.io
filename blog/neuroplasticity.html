      <p class="blog-post">
        Neuroplasticity is the concept of the brain being able to change and
        adapt over time - different pathways can be cultivated in the brain
        based on your thinking and experiences, but these can change over time,
        and it is possible to intentially choose which pathways to both
        strengthen and weaken.
        
      </br>
      </br>
        This concept is beneficial to understand, as without knowing that something can change or how to, it can provide additional barriers to growing and exploring as a person. Knowing that harmful patterns of thinking can be changed regardless of age can allow for continued personal growth as an adult, and avoid getting stuck in long term thinking and behavioural patterns - it's already difficult to change habits that have been ingrained for decades, but thinking it is impossible to change them adds another unnecessary barrier. Our brains can keep learning and changing our whole life - it doesn't stop when you become an adult, and excelling at new skills and gaining new abilities is always an option!

      </br>
      </br>
      Engaging with the concept of neuroplasticity help with learning new skills - not immediately at something doesn't mean this will always be the case, it'll just take time and practice to form the pathways to allow for it. This engagement can also encourage putting importance on interrupting negative spirals and trying to reframe self doubt and stress because of it's long lasting impact. This can also hopefully lead to more self kindness and patience (especially when already stressed).
      </br>
      </br>
      Increasing neuroplasticity is done by engaging in novel and stimulating things where you are able to learn and grow and get positive feedback for putting in that effort! Additionally, prioritising self care and encouraging mental flexibility for reasoning allows for conscious effort to be put into strengthening positive mental pathways. Some examples of this engagement are:

      * learning new things such as languages, skills etc...
     </br>
     </br>
      * life enrichment through experiencing new things e.g. travelling
     </br>
     </br>
      * sleeping enough to allow neurons to grow and strengthen
     </br>
     </br>
      * physical exercise
     </br>
     </br>
      * grounding exercises e.g. mindfullness
     </br>
     </br>
      * playing games e.g board games, video games etc...
     </br>

      <h2 class="blog-post-heading">Growth Mindset</h2>
     <p class="blog-post">
      A growth mindset is the concept that being good at something isn't an innate trait, but rather that someone's capactity and talent can be improved over time. This can be seen as relevant for everyone allows you to be aware that you can improve in whatever you are working on - where you start is not an indicate of your full ability! This allows for intrinsic motivation that is curious of wanting to learn and dive deeper and put in effort in for yourself, not extrinsic motivation which is about other peoples wants, and their opinions of you. Knowing you can do better allows for the opportunity to actually do so.
     </br>
     </br>
      While at a personal level this concept isn't a new one, it can still be helpful to integrate into my own learning journey. When i get stuck remembering that this doesn't mean I can't do something, that this is an opportunity for growth and learning rather than an opportunity to fail. This can also lead to an improvement on how I frame any challenges I come across as ways to get feedback, figure out what I need to put work into and an ability to practice that, as opposed to a reason for excessive stress.
