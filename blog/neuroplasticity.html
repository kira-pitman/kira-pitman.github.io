        Neuroplasticity is the concept of the brain being able to change and
        adapt over time - different pathways can be cultivated in the brain
        based on your thinking and experiences, but these can change over time,
        and it is possible to intentially choose which pathways to both
        strengthen and weaken.
        
      </br>
      </br>
        This concept is beneficial to understand, as without knowing that something can change or how to, it can provide additional barriers to growing and exploring as a person. Knowing that harmful patterns of thinking can be changed regardless of age can allow for continued personal growth as an adult, and avoid getting stuck in long term thinking and behavioural patterns - it's already difficult to change habits that have been ingrained for decades, but thinking it is impossible to change them adds another unnecessary barrier. Our brains can keep learning and changing our whole life - it doesn't stop when you become an adult, and excelling at new skills and gaining new abilities is always an option!

      </br>
      </br>
      Engaging with the concept of neuroplasticity help with learning new skills - not immediately at something doesn't mean this will always be the case, it'll just take time and practice to form the pathways to allow for it. This engagement can also encourage putting importance on interrupting negative spirals and trying to reframe self doubt and stress because of it's long lasting impact. This can also hopefully lead to more self kindness and patience (especially when already stressed).
      </br>
      </br>
      Increasing neuroplasticity is done by engaging in novel and stimulating things where you are able to learn and grow and get positive feedback for putting in that effort! Additionally, prioritising self care and encouraging mental flexibility for reasoning allows for conscious effort to be put into strengthening positive mental pathways. Some examples of this engagement are:

      * learning new things such as languages, skills etc...
     </br>
     </br>
      * life enrichment through experiencing new things e.g. travelling
     </br>
     </br>
      * sleeping enough to allow neurons to grow and strengthen
     </br>
     </br>
      * physical exercise
     </br>
     </br>
      * grounding exercises e.g. mindfullness
     </br>
     </br>
      * playing games e.g board games, video games etc...
