        A permenant job position was made for me at a previous workplace, however it would have meant that I'd have to work on projects that were being contracted out to the usa military. I chose to not apply for it as I didn't want to work on anything for the us military, especially not for technology such as satellites which are guarranteably used destructively.

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

      <p class="blog-post">
        I am very honest, almost to a fault, which allows me to be very genuine with others, and build genuine and sustainbable relationship of whatever kind. Hopefully this lets me work well with others both collaboratively, as well as being able to be honest about when I need help. </br>
      </br>
I am very committed and convicted in myself and my beliefs and that they are very well founded particularly that I always assume the best in people and that if others aren't at their best it is because they are not being loved and supported enough. I think this will help me when I collaborate with others, and hopefully allow me to contribute to a working environment that allows for vulunerability and for others to show up and communicate authentically.</br>
</br>

I am also very intrinsically driven and do things for myself and my own reasons rather than from external pressures. Hopefully this lets me be able to prioritise my course work when needed, but also prioritise other aspects of my life when required. It'll also hopefully mean that I can push myself to get what I want out of the course without worrying as much about what other people are thinking of my work (outside of constructive feedback).

      <h2 class="blog-post-question">
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        
Learning:
I am used to not being able to do things and not getting help so will assume that I will just have to struggle excessively to get anywhere and that things will never click properly. I also kinda got into the habit a bit from undergrad that if I couldn't do something it was because I didn't have the knowledge or ability e.g. being given assignment problems that had to be solved with maths I had never learnt, so if I hit too much of a roadblock and can't solve it in some arbitrarily decided time frame then I give up and just accept I can't do it. This isn't always the case but can crop up when there is a lot of new material that I can't get a holistic view of the connections between. Impact learning journey as if I get too stuck and can't figure it out or other's can't help me then I just won't do something.</br>
</br>

Career development:
shit all mentoring - litearlly been told to my face that people aren't going to and don't want to help me. Often dropped and not given same support as the men I have been around in the all men groups I have worked in. Not really going to expect anyone will help me or reach out to me, that I'll just be left to work by myself
</br>
</br>
a lot of insecurity/imposter syndrome - honestly wasn't super super good at physics and struggled so much more than others, don't think I belong, haven't really fit in with the culture of the workplaces I have been in before so don't believe I should really belong anywhere or that there is space for me in STEM. </br>
</br>

impact confidence and ability to work collaboratively as can't entirely trust that anything I contribute will be wanted or worthwhile. don't necessarily think others will want to work with me or want me there so can impact how much I will want to proactively contribute or be present.

      <h2 class="blog-post-question">
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.

        - tutoring student 
        - student doesn't want to go through necessary reflection of in class test
        - tried to ask what part they don't want to do, where they are at, assume the best of them, ask if we need to park it, or split up into smaller bits to make it approachable</br>
      </br>
        - kind of effective? they still didn't want to do it, and kinda begrugendly went though it, but wasn't very present or engaged and kinda rushed through discussion and points to get it over with rather than having it be a constructive exercise.</br>
      </br>
        
        - would now give choice of how to approach it - kinda gentle parenting, where not do we do it or not or park it, but what part do you want to look at first, how do u want to approach it i.e. give autonomy over situation and depth of reflection, and let approach in their own way to build intrinsic motivation and self confidence, rather than getting them to relent. means that they will build constructive and autonomous pathways over reflection rather than just disliking it and pushing through. encourages reframing of situation in a constructive way that works for them, and will hopefully apply to other uncomfortable aspects of like
