        There are three main models of emotional intelligence: 1. Ability model
        2. Mixed model 3. Trait model Ability model: * Views emotions as useful
        sources of information that assist in making sense of and navigate the
        social environment. This model is based around the theory that EQ has
        four types of abilities: percieving emotions, using emotions,
        understanding emotions, managing emotions. Mixed model: * Views EQ as
        having a wide array of compentincies and skills that drive leadership
        performance; self awareness, self regulation, social skills, empathy,
        and motivation. Trait model: * This model is based on EQ being about the
        self perception someone has of their own emotional abilitites.

      <h2 class="blog-post-heading">How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        Emotional Quotient is a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate,
        and express their emotions. Intelligence quotient is a way of expressing
        a person's cognitive ablity. This can include things such as: 
      </br>
    </br>
        * Visual
        and spatial processing 
      </br>
    </br>
        * Knowledge of the world 
      </br>
    </br>
        * Fluid reasoning  
      </br>
      </br>
       * Working memory and short-term memory
      </br>
    </br>
     * Quantitative reasoning  </br>
    </br>
    
    IQ involves processing, knowledge, memory, and reasoning and affects
        academics, expertise, critical thinking, and logic. It’s important for
        planning and strategy, as well as more logic based disciplines such as
        the sciences and maths.

      <h2 class="blog-post-heading">Why is EQ so important?</h2>

      <p class="blog-post">
        EQ is the driver behind thoughts and actions that take your emotions
        into account, and is crucial for socialisation and communication across
        all areas of life. It can also have an impact on your physical health
        too. 
      </br>
    </br>

        Important for: 
      </br>
    </br>
        * Performance at work: emotional intelligence helps you navigate social
        complexities, lead and motivate others, and can assist in exceling in
        you career. It is often more important than IQ for job interviews and
        ability to suceed in your career.
      </br>
    </br>
     * Physical health: If you are unable
        to manage your emotions, then it is likely you can't manage stress.
        Consistently high levels of stress raise blood pressure, suppresses
        immune system, increase heart attack and stroke risk, infertility, and
        can also age you. 
        
      </br>
    </br>
    * Mental health: Lower EQ increases your
        vulnerability to anxiety and depression. Furthermore, if you can't
        understand, be comfortable with, or manage emotions, you will struggle
        to form long term relationships. This can leave you being lonely and
        isolated and further exacerbate any mental health issues. 
        
      </br>
    </br>
    *
        Relationships: Being able to understand what you are feeling and why is
        important for communicating effectively and building and maintaining
        stronger relationships at work and in personal life.
        
      </br>
    </br>
    * Social
        intelligence: Being in tune with your emotions serves a social purpose
        and connects you to the people around you. It lets you determine which
        people you should connect with and will be good for you (and vica versa
        not).
